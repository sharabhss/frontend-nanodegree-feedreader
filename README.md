# Feedreader Testing

## Summary

This project is part of the Udacity FEND and the detailed project overview can be found below. The requirements were to use Jasmine to write test codes for a given application that reads RSS feeds to make sure everything is working as it should and there would be no issues later.

## Set up and run
* Download zip or clone github repository
* Inside "frontend-nanodegree-feedreader" folder, there is an "index.html" file, which is the main file to run the application
* The folder also includes this README file as well as the CSS, Jasmine, Fonts, and JS files used to make the app. Nothing else needs to changed to run the current version of the app.
